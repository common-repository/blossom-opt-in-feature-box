<p>
Thank you for installing Blossom Opt_in Feature Boxx. For Cloudflare users, Turn off hotlinking or put logo/image in a new folder called "hotlink-ok" on example.com. Any images in the hotlink-ok folder will not be checked for 
hotlinking. Hotlink Protection prevents your images from being used by other sites. This can reduce the bandwidth consumed by your origin server. When enabled, Cloudflare Hotlink Protection Open 
external link blocks all HTTP referrers that are not part of your domain or zone. You can allow certain images to be hotlinked by placing them in a directory named 
hotlink-ok as seen above. The hotlink-ok directory can be placed anywhere on your 
website. Blossom is an attention grabbing feature box that conditionally pops up at the center of the user's screen for maximum visibility and user engagement. It can be used as the 
classic opt-in box to capture user's email, or simply to display important content such as an announcement or even an advertisement. Please visit [demo](https://walexconcepts.com/wordpress/plugin-demo/).
